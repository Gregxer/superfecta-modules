Unsupported CallerID Superfecta Modules
=======================================

This repo is for storage of Superfecta lookup modules that are not officially supported by the Superfecta project. Upload these files to:

`<webroot>/admin/modules/superfecta/sources`

on Centos sytems this is probably:

`/var/www/html/admin/modules/superfecta/sources/`

change ownership and permissions to match the files existing in that folder

```
chown asterisk:asterisk <filename>
chmod 0775 <filename>
```


and configure thru the GUI like normal.
